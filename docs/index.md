# Boise Software Developers Group

## Welcome to BSDG!

Boise Software Developers Group, Inc. (BSDG) is a state and federal 501(c)3 non-profit organization with the mission of supporting and nurturing technical communities in and around Boise, ID.

Born out of a longtime usergroup (BSDG) and a desire to bring events like [Boise Code Camp](https://boisecodecamp.com) back to the valley, the non-profit was founded in early 2024 to help our communities thrive again.
