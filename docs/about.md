## About

Boise Software Developer Group, aka, BSDG, is a local organization of software developers who meet monthly to discuss software development technologies. Meetings feature local developers giving presentations on technology topics of their choosing. Any topic related to the wide field of software development is welcome. The meetings include a time of questions, answers, and discussions. 

These meetings provide great opportunities for those who would like to learn about new technologies in person, meet and interact with other developers in the area. For those who are interested in giving presentations, these meetings provide opportunities to demonstrate skills, knowledge, and the experience of presenting information to a friendly audience. 

Meetings are normally scheduled for the 2nd Tuesday of each month, 6:00 at Boise CodeWorks. Check the [BSDG Meetup page](/events/index.html) for information about the next meeting. 

If you are interested in presenting a technology of interest to you at a meeting, visit the [BSDG discord channel](https://discord.gg/FILL_ME_IN) and post information about the topic youâ€™d like to present!

BSDG has operated as an informal organization since its start back in the late 1990s. In 2024, it formally organized as an Idaho Nonprofit entity and a Federal 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In that process, it has also assumed organizational control of [Boise Code Camp](https://boisecodecamp.com), a yearly event held in the spring. BSDG helps to organize other events to serve local area developers.
