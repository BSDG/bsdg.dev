Phil covers who uses it, what makes it special, and some practical use cases. Then, he will demo installing packages, configuring GNOME with Home Manager, and even getting a 2014 MacBook Airâ€™s camera workingâ€”all with a few lines of code.</p><p>Phil Daum is a software engineering apprentice at a nonprofit coding bootcamp, honing his skills in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Before transitioning into tech full-time, he taught elementary school art, using Agile-inspired classroom management techniques (because even art projects need a Kanban board sometimes). Philâ€™s tech journey started as a side hustle, building WordPress sites for artists and small businesses while taking on occasional IT challenges. Now back in his home state of Idaho after years of wandering the West, he enjoys blending creativity with code and diving into new tech tools</p>',7)]))}const g=t(o,[["render",r]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
